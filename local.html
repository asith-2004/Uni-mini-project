                <h3>Traffic Congestion</h3>
                <p>
                    Minuwangoda, like many rapidly developing towns, experiences significant traffic congestion, particularly at key junctions and main roads during peak hours. This leads to long commuter delays (often 20-30 minutes or more), increased fuel consumption, air pollution, and heightened frustration among residents and businesses. The current traffic infrastructure, often lacking modern signaling or proper lane demarcation, struggles to cope with the growing volume of vehicles, creating chaotic and unsafe conditions for both drivers and pedestrians.

                <h3>Waste Disposal and Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Minuwangoda's waste management system faces challenges from irregular waste collection schedules and a prevalent issue of illegal dumping in undesignated areas. This results in overflowing waste bins in public spaces and residential zones, creating unhygienic conditions, attracting pests, and posing significant public health risks. Furthermore, low public awareness and participation in recycling programs means that a vast majority of recyclable materials end up in landfills, straining the existing disposal infrastructure and contributing to environmental pollution.

                <h3>Water Resource Management</h3>
                <p>Minuwangoda, like many areas, may face challenges in efficient water management, ranging from water leakage in aging infrastructure to inconsistent supply during dry seasons or periods of high demand. This can lead to water wastage, increased operational costs for water authorities, and inconvenience or even scarcity for residents in certain areas or times. Poor monitoring of water consumption can also hinder conservation efforts.</p>
